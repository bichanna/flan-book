# The Flan Standard Library
Flan’s standard library is quite extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below.
The library contains built-in modules (written in Rust) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Flan programmers,
as well as modules written in Flan that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming.
